<h1>Programming Event Platform</h1>

<p>This project was developed during the Ignite Lab event from Rocketseat.</p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>• The Ignite Lab is a platform that reunites relevant stuff about technology. You can watch tutorials, livestreams, and anything else related to coding! The main purpose of this project is to bring a simple, but efficient way to spread knowledge to our growing community.

<p>• To participate of the event, firstly, you need to subscribe into it using your name and e-mail.</p>
